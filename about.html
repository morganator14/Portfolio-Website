                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>During my time at The Ohio State University, I studied filmmaking, and focused on animation. 
                    I completed coursework in 3D computer animation, worked with real-time game engines, motion 
                    capture techniques, and live-action filmmaking. I also completed a Studio Art minor to 
                    strengthen my fine art skills, and learned Python scripting which I applied to my computer 
                    animation projects.  These courses challenged me to practice every area of the animation pipeline, 
                    while also putting emphasis on developing strong narratives.

                    I’ve worked as Video Developer for the Ohio State Media Marketing and Communications Scholars for 
                    four years and in my senior year took the role of Lead Video Developer. I led a team of nine other 
                    Video Developers, I coordinated interviews and shoots, allocated projects, reviewed work, and 
                    distributed our videos for large audiences.

                     I’ve also worked as a Motion Graphics Intern for Rocket Companies in Detroit and for the North 
                     Suburban YMCA in Chicago. In these roles, I created motion graphics for internal and external 
                     purposes. I worked closely with marketing Directors and underwent rigorous review, all while 
                     adhering to strict brand guidelines.</p>
